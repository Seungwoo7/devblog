## Introduction 

This is the process of planning and making UX/UI for the users who play the game. By having this process, users can see the game better visually.

## UX structure

UX which means "User experience" that encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products. In this process designers of UX make a product or service usable, enjoyable, and accessible.

We figured out how to connect the pages of each scene(of the game) more naturally and smoothly.

## UI (structure)

UI which means user interface (UI) is the point of human-computer interaction and communication in a device. This can include display screens, keyboards, a mouse and the appearance of a desktop.

At this process, we separated UI to two parts which was 'structure' and 'visual'

We thought about how to make the game more specifically or more simply so that the users can easily access the game.

In this process, we made the visual pages which the users can actually see while they play the game.

## UX (visual)
