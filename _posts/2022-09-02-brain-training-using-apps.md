>reference: Bruno Bonnechère et al. 2021. Brain training using cognitive apps can improve cognitive performance and processing speed in older adults


##Introduction


---

- Users who trained with the games improved regardless of age in terms of scores and processing speed throughout the 100 sessions, suggesting that old and very old adults can improve their cognitive performance using CMG 
in real-life use.

## Results

---

 We first analyzed the number of days needed to reach the 100 sessions for 
each CMG
 Statistically signifcant difꠓferences were observed for the diferent CMG (p<0.001) and within the CMG for the diferent age groups for 
Memory Sweep (p=0.013), Babble Bots (p<0.001) and Unique (p<0.001)

 As for the initial scores, we 
observed an interesting linear trend between age and session, indicating that all participants improved in all 
CMG but that the progress was slower in older participants

For Word Pairs we observed an decrease in the processing speed in all age groups. 
For Square Numbers, Unique and Rush Back there was a statistically signifcant increase for all participant age 
groups, however as for the score, the increase of the processing speed is more marked for younger participants. 
For Must Sort, only participants aged 70 and over presented a decrease in processing speed while the other age 
groups presented a slight increase, but in both cases the magnitude was relatively small

## Discussions

we showed that CMG scores are correlated with the cognitive abilities of older adults with and without 
cognitive impairments16

When investigating the scores of the CMG, we observed statistically signifcant linear decreases with the 
increasing age of the participants, and conversely, a signifcant decrease in processing speed. Tese results are 
in accordance with neuropsychological and physiological data: aging is indeed related to a decrease in cognitive

When investigating the scores of the CMG, we observed statistically signifcant linear decreases with the 
increasing age of the participants, and conversely, a signifcant decrease in processing speed. Tese results are 
in accordance with neuropsychological and physiological data: aging is indeed related to a decrease in cognitive function17 and an increase in reaction time18. Tis observation supports that our outcomes are sensitive to ageꠓrelated changes in cognitive function.
